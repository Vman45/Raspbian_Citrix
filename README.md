# Raspbian_Citrix
Instructions for configuring a Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB) to work with the Citrix ICA client (icaclient_20.04.0.21_armhf.deb).

JINKSTO: most of my repo is private because things that I say don't represent the views of my employer.  If you want access to a specific repo send me a DM via the usually places.

# Background
Someone on the team thought it'd be fun if we could get a thin-client connection working on Raspbian.  I spent a lot of time putting it together and working out the finicky bits.  However, with the latest versions of Raspbian and Citrix Workstation it's really very easy.
